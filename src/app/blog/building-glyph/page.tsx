        <h1>Building Glyph: from an idea to a paid product</h1>
        <p>A few decisions, a public launch, and an ongoing learning process.</p>

        <h2>An identity, beyond a logo</h2>
        <p>The idea behind Glyph was simple: a logo alone doesn’t give a founder a brand. They also need colours, typography, guidelines, and assets they can actually use in their product.</p>
        <p>I built Glyph solo over a few months. The early approach included grid-based SVG logos and developer exports for React and Tailwind. I wanted the output to connect design decisions with implementation.</p>
        <h2>Putting it in front of people</h2>
        <p>I launched in February 2026, shared it on X, posted on Reddit, and listed it on Peerlist. That got the product out of my own workflow and into other people’s hands.</p>
        <p>I initially pictured indie hackers and solo developers using it. As people started paying, I began questioning that assumption: some seemed to be non-technical founders who wanted a professional identity quickly. I’m still figuring out how much they value code exports compared with the identity itself.</p>
        <h2>The work after payment</h2>
        <p>One monthly subscriber ran into an access issue after paying. I had to upgrade their account manually and provide an extra month. It was a concrete reminder that the payment flow and account access need the same care as the generator.</p>
        <p>Glyph is still evolving. I’m working on output quality and consistency, and deciding which improvements matter before making bigger changes. It’s a paid product, but there are still plenty of questions to answer.</p>
